Understanding Color:
- Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
- Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).
- When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.
- The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue — just like on a television screen.
- Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.
The hex value is provided next to the pound or hash
# symbol.

Color Values:
- RGB Values - Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
- Hex Codes - Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
- Color Names - Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
- Hue - Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.
- Saturation - Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.
- Brightness - Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.

Contrast: When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
- Low Contrast: Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
- A lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with
visual impairments and color blindness.
- It also affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screens (which is increasingly common as people use handheld devices outdoors).
- High Contrast: Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
- If you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however, then too much contrast can make it harder to read, too.
- Medium Contrast: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
- You can reduce contrast by using dark gray text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background.

* If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.

CSS3: Opacity
- Opacity: CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
- The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).
- rgba: The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity. 
- This value is known as an alpha value and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity). 
- The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied (not child elements).
- Because some browsers will
not recognize RGBA colors, you can offer a fallback so that they display a solid color. If there are two rules that apply to the same element, the latter of the two will take priority. 
- To create the fallback, you can specify a color as a hex code, color name or RGB value, followed by the rule that specifies an RGBA value. 
- If the browser understands RGBA colors it will use that rule. If it doesn't, it will use the RGB value.
* At the time of writing, the opacity and rgba properties are only supported by the most recent browsers.

CSS3: HSL Colors
- CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
- Hue: Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
- Saturation: Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
- Lightness: Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.
- Please note that lightness is a different concept to brightness. Graphic design software (such as Photoshop and GIMP) have color pickers that use hue, saturation, and brightness — but brightness only adds black, whereas lightness offers both white and black.

Usage of HSL: The hsl color property has
been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed
by individual values inside parentheses for: Hue, Saturation, Lightness
- Hue: This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
- Saturation: This is expressed as a percentage.
- Lightness: This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.

HSLA:
The hsla color property allows you to specify color properties using hue, saturation, and lightness as above, and adds a fourth value which represents transparency (just like the rgba property). The a stands for:
 - Alpha: This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency. 

- Because older browsers do not recognize HSL and HSLA values, it is a good idea to add an extra rule which specifies the color using a hex code, RGB value, or color name. 
- This should appear before the rule that uses the HSL or HSLA value.
- This provides a fallback because if there are two rules that apply to the same element in CSS, the latter of the two always takes priority.
- This means that if the browser understands HSL and HSLA colors, it will use that rule; and if it does not, it will use the first rule.
