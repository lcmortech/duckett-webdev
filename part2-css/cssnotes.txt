Extra Notes on CSS

Review from HTML Notes:
- Block level elements look like they start on a new line.
- Examples include the <h1> - <h6>, <p> and <div> elements.
- Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. 
- Examples include <b>, <i>, <img>, <em> and <span>.

Initial Notes on CSS:
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
