Extra Notes on CSS

Review from HTML Notes:
- Block level elements look like they start on a new line.
- Examples include the <h1> - <h6>, <p> and <div> elements.
- Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. 
- Examples include <b>, <i>, <img>, <em> and <span>.

General Notes on CSS:
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
- CSS associates styles rules with HTML elements
- A CSS rules contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

selector {
    (declaration)
    property: value;
}

ex: 
p {
    font-family: Arial;
}
- This rule indicates that all <p> elements should be shown in the Arial typeface. 

h1, h2, h3 {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: yellow;
}

Style Examples:
Boxes:
- Width and Height
Borders (color, width, and style)
Background color and images
Position in the browser window.
Text:
- Typeface
- Size
- Color
- Italics, bold, uppercase,
lowercase, small-caps
Specific:
- There are also specific ways in which you can style certain elements such as lists, tables, and forms.

Why use external style sheets? When building a website there several advantages to placng your CSS rules in a separate style sheet:
- All of your web pages can share the same style sheet. 
- This is achieved by using the <link> element on each HTML page of your site to link to the same CSS document. 
- This means that the same code does not need to be repeated in every page (which results in less code and smaller HTML pages).
