Extra Notes on CSS

Review from HTML Notes:
- Block level elements look like they start on a new line.
- Examples include the <h1> - <h6>, <p> and <div> elements.
- Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. 
- Examples include <b>, <i>, <img>, <em> and <span>.

General Notes on CSS:
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
- CSS associates styles rules with HTML elements
- A CSS rules contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

selector {
    (declaration)
    property: value;
}

ex: 
p {
    font-family: Arial;
}
- This rule indicates that all <p> elements should be shown in the Arial typeface. 

h1, h2, h3 {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: yellow;
}

Style Examples:
Boxes:
- Width and Height
Borders (color, width, and style)
Background color and images
Position in the browser window.
Text:
- Typeface
- Size
- Color
- Italics, bold, uppercase,
lowercase, small-caps
Specific:
- There are also specific ways in which you can style certain elements such as lists, tables, and forms.

Why use external style sheets? When building a website there several advantages to placng your CSS rules in a separate style sheet:
- All of your web pages can share the same style sheet. 
- This is achieved by using the <link> element on each HTML page of your site to link to the same CSS document. 
- This means that the same code does not need to be repeated in every page (which results in less code and smaller HTML pages).

Sometimes you might consider placing CSS rules in the same page as your HTML code:
- If you are just creating a single page, you might decide to put the rules in the same file to keep everything in one place. (However, many authors would consider it better practice to keep the CSS in a separate file.)
- If you have one page which requires a few extra rules (that are not used by the rest of the site), you might consider using CSS in the same page. (Again, most authors consider it better practice to keep all CSS rules in a separate file.)
- Most of the examples in this book place the CSS rules in the <head> of the document (using the <style> element) rather than a separate document. This is simply to save you opening two files to see how the CSS examples work.

Different versions of CSS:
- CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it.
- In the same way that there have been several versions of HTML, there have also been different versions of CSS.
- Browsers did not implement all CSS features at once, so some older browsers do not support every property.
- This is mentioned when it is likely to affect you, along with notes where CSS properties might not behave as expected.
- Before launching any new site,
it is important to test it in more than one browser, because there can be slight differences in how browsers display the pages.
You do not need lots of computers to test your site, as there are online tools to show you what a page looks like in multiple browsers:
BrowserCam.com 
BrowserLab.Adobe.com 
BrowserShots.org 
CrossBrowserTesting.com
- Using these tools, it is a good idea to check the site on different operating systems (PC, Mac, and Linux) and in older versions of the major browsers, as well as recent versions.
- When you look at your site in more than one browser, you might find that some elements on your page do not look as you expect them to.
When a CSS property does not display as expected, it is generally referred to as a browser quirk or Css bug.
- Some common browser bugs are discussed in this book, but there are many smaller bugs that only occur in rare situations, or on old browsers that few people use.
If you come across a CSS bug, you can use your favorite search engine to try and find a solution. Or you can check these sites:

Understanding Color:
- Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
- Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).
- When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.
- The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue — just like on a television screen.
- Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.
The hex value is provided next to the pound or hash
# symbol. 
- There is also a good color picking tool at: colorschemedesigner.com

Color Values:
- RGB Values - Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
- Hex Codes - Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
- Color Names - Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
- Hue - Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.
- Saturation - Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.
- Brightness - Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.

Contrast: When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
- Low Contrast: Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
- A lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with
visual impairments and color blindness.
- It also affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screens (which is increasingly common as people use handheld devices outdoors).
- High Contrast: Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
- If you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however, then too much contrast can make it harder to read, too.
- Medium Contrast: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
- You can reduce contrast by using dark gray text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background.

* If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.
* To check contrast there is a handy online tool at: www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html

CSS3: Opacity
- Opacity: CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
- The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).
- rgba: The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity. 
- This value is known as an alpha value and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity). 
- The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied (not child elements).
- Because some browsers will
not recognize RGBA colors, you can offer a fallback so that they display a solid color. If there are two rules that apply to the same element, the latter of the two will take priority. 
- To create the fallback, you can specify a color as a hex code, color name or RGB value, followed by the rule that specifies an RGBA value. 
- If the browser understands RGBA colors it will use that rule. If it doesn't, it will use the RGB value.
* At the time of writing, the opacity and rgba properties are only supported by the most recent browsers.

CSS3: HSL Colors
- CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
- Hue: Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
- Saturation: Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
- Lightness: Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.
- Please note that lightness is a different concept to brightness. Graphic design software (such as Photoshop and GIMP) have color pickers that use hue, saturation, and brightness — but brightness only adds black, whereas lightness offers both white and black.

Usage of HSL: The hsl color property has
been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed
by individual values inside parentheses for: Hue, Saturation, Lightness
- Hue: This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
- Saturation: This is expressed as a percentage.
- Lightness: This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.

HSLA:
The hsla color property allows you to specify color properties using hue, saturation, and lightness as above, and adds a fourth value which represents transparency (just like the rgba property). The a stands for:
 - Alpha: This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency. 

- Because older browsers do not recognize HSL and HSLA values, it is a good idea to add an extra rule which specifies the color using a hex code, RGB value, or color name. 
- This should appear before the rule that uses the HSL or HSLA value.
- This provides a fallback because if there are two rules that apply to the same element in CSS, the latter of the two always takes priority.
- This means that if the browser understands HSL and HSLA colors, it will use that rule; and if it does not, it will use the first rule.

INTRO TO TEXT (CH12):
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
- Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
- Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)
The formatting of your text can have a significant effect on how readable your pages are. As we look through these properties I will also give you some design tips on how to display your type.

Typeface Terminology:
Serif - Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.
Sans-Serif - Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
Monospace - Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)
- In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read.
- Screens have a lower resolution than print. So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.
- Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier to follow.

Fonts: Weight, Style, Stretch
Weight:
Light
Medium
Bold
Black
 - The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also affect the amount of white space and contrast on a page.

Style:
Normal
Italic
Oblique
 - Italic fonts have a cursive aspect to some of the lettering. 
 - Oblique font styles take the normal style and put it on an angle.

Stretch:
Condensed
Regular
Extended
 - In condensed (or narrow) versions of the font, letters are thinner and closer together. 
 - In expanded versions they are thicker and further apart.

 Choosing a Typeface for your Website:
 - When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.

 Serif - Serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters.
 Ex: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman

 Sans-Serif - Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters and therefore have a much cleaner design.
 Ex: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica

 * As a result, sites often use a small set of typefaces that are installed on most computers (shown above). There are some techniques to get around this limitation (which are covered on pages 271-272).
* It is possible to specify more than one typeface and create an order of preference (in case the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed). This is sometimes referred to as a font stack.

Additional Typefaces: Monospace, Cursive, Fantasy
Monospace - Every letter in a monospace typeface is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)
Ex: Courier, Courier New
Cursive - Cursive fonts either have joining strokes or other cursive characteristics, such as handwriting styles.
Ex: Comic Sans MS, Monotype Corsiva
Fantasy - Fantasy fonts are usually decorative fonts and are often used for titles. They're not designed for long bodies of text.
Ex: Impact, Haettenschweiler

Techniques that offer a wider choice of Typefaces: There are several ways to use fonts other than those listed on the previous page. However, typefaces are subject to copyright, so the techniques you can choose from are limited by their respective licenses.
Ex: Font-Family, Font-Face, Service-Based Font-Face

* All are suitable for any length of text

Font-Family:
- The user's computer needs the typeface installed. CSS is used to specify the interface.
Covered on - Pages 273-374
Issues - There is a limited choice of typefaces that most users have installed.
Licensing - You are not distributing the typeface, so there is no licensing issue.
Choice of Typefaces - There is a limited choice because the font needs to be installed on users' computers.
