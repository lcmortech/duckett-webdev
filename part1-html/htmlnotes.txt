- not visable to users, but tells search engines about your page
- it's an empty element and does not have a closing tag, but uses its attributes to carry information
- its most common attributes are the "name" and "content" attributes, which tend to be used together to specify properties of the entire page
L Values used within the "name" attribute of the <meta> tag:
"description" - contains a description of the page
"keywords" - contains a list of comma-separated words that a user might search on to find the page.
"robots" - indicates whether search engines should add this to their search results or not. - A value of noindex can be used if this page should not be added. 
- A value of nofollow can be used if search engines should add this page in their results but not any pages that it links to.

- The <meta> element also uses the "http-equiv" and "content" attributes in pairs: (corresponds to ex8a)
author: this defines the author of the webpage
pragma: this prevents the browser from caching the page
expires: indicates when the page should expire and no longer be cached
