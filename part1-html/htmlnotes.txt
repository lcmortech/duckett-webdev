Lists:
<ul>, <ol>, <dl> (definition list) -> <dt> (term) and <dd> (definition)

Tables:
<table> -> <tr> ->  <td> or <th>
colspan, rowspan attributes


Block Level Elements:
Examples of block elements are:
<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>
<div> is the main block level grouping element

Inline Level Elements:
Examples of inline elements are:
<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img> (NOT block)
<span> is the main inline level grouping block element

<iframe> - iframe is an abbreviation for "inline frame"
attributes used: src, height, width, and seamless (html5)
html 4 and earlier attributes: scrolling and frameborder (removed in html5)

Meta tag <meta>:
- lives inside the <head> element and contains info about that webpage
- not visable to users, but tells search engines about your page
- it's an empty element and does not have a closing tag, but uses its attributes to carry information
- its most common attributes are the "name" and "content" attributes, which tend to be used together to specify properties of the entire page
L Values used within the "name" attribute of the <meta> tag:
"description" - contains a description of the page
"keywords" - contains a list of comma-separated words that a user might search on to find the page.
"robots" - indicates whether search engines should add this to their search results or not. - A value of noindex can be used if this page should not be added. 
- A value of nofollow can be used if search engines should add this page in their results but not any pages that it links to.

- The <meta> element also uses the "http-equiv" and "content" attributes in pairs: (corresponds to ex8a)
author: this defines the author of the webpage
pragma: this prevents the browser from caching the page
expires: indicates when the page should expire and no longer be cached

Escape Characters:
- Not all fonts support escape characters, so it's important to specify a different font that does in your CSS code.
Copyright = &copy, &#169
Ampersand = &amp, &#38
Registered Trademark = &reg, &#174
Trademark = &trade, &#8482

Flash Video and Audio:
- Flash player is now defunct, so these notes will focus on HTML5 video and audio instead

HTML5 Video:
<video> - This element is used to add html5 video to a web page. It takes the following attributes:
- src
- poster
- width, height
- controls
- autoplay
- loop
- preload
- none
- auto
- metadata

src - specifies the path to the video

poster - allows you to specify an image to show while the video is downloading or until the user tells the video to play (thumbnail)

width, height - specify the size of the player in pixels

controls - has the video supply its own controls for playback

autoplay - specifies that the file should play automatically

loop - indicates for the video to start playing again once it has ended

preload - this attribute tells the browser what to do when the page loads. It can have one of three values: none, auto, and metadata
none - the browser should not load the video until the user presses play
auto - the browser should download the video when the page loads
metadata - the browser should just collect information such as the size, first frame, track list, and duration

<source> - This element specifies the location of the file to be played. You can use the source element inside the video element, as a replacement to the source attribute on the open <video> tag. Ex:
<video>
    <source />
</video>
- You can also use multiple <source> elements to specify that the video is available in diff formats.
Attributes taken by the <source> element:
src - specifies the path to the video
type - tells the browser what format the video is. It prevents the browser from downloading some of the video file to see if it can be played (saves bandwidth)
codecs - supplies the codec that was used to encode the video. It uses single and double quotes in the type attribute when supplied.
- If the browser does not support the <video> element or the format of video, it will display whatever is between the opening <video> and closing </video> tags.

Adding audio using:
- A Hosting Service
- Use Flash (No)
- Use HTML5 (Yes)

Using the <audio> tag is very similar to the <video> tag
